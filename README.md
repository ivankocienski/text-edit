# Text Edit

A text editor written in lisp. But isn't it hard to write a text editor? I don't know- so I am finding out. What I should be doing is python or ruby or something more employable than lisp but nuts to it all- lisp is fun.

Not really finished so if you are curious you can kinda figure out how to load this and run it on your own. Good luck!
